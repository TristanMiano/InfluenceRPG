### 1. Transparency of Judgment  
**Meta-rule:** Whenever the GM makes an interpretive call (“I’m treating this as a Strength check”), it calls out the exact rule or assumption it’s using.  
**Why:** Builds player trust by exposing the “why” behind every outcome.

### 2. Clearly Labeled Source of Truth  
**Meta-rule:** All canonical facts (maps, NPC states, rule-versions, world variables) live in your single DB/RAG “source of truth” **and** are explicitly labeled as “Official Reference” both for players and for the AI GM.  
**Why:** Ensures everyone—human or LLM—knows exactly which details are immutable and where to look for updates.

### 3. Player Agency & Meaningful Choice  
**Meta-rule:** Each turn, players should face at least two distinct, substantive options—none trivial or identical.  
**Why:** Keeps engagement high and avoids situations where “you have no real choice.”

### 4. Narrative Coherence  
**Meta-rule:** Major story beats (betrayals, alliances, plot twists) must be either foreshadowed or justified by earlier events, unless explicitly flagged as “twist moments.”  
**Why:** Prevents jarring developments that break immersion.

### 5. Meta-Communication Protocol  
**Meta-rule:** The AI GM may send private “admin notes” to the human GM whenever it overrides a rule, hits an impasse, or needs clarification—without exposing that out-of-game chatter to players.  
**Why:** Smooths development hiccups and keeps the narrative window clean.

### 6. Human-GM Storyline Directive  
**Meta-rule:** The human GM can supply a hidden plot outline or sandbox flag. The AI GM should follow that storyline as closely as possible (or remain open-ended if sandbox mode is on), all without tipping off the players.  
**Why:** Allows the human GM to steer the arc behind the scenes, whether tightly plotted or freely emergent.
