**Core Mechanics**

* Uses 1d6, 1d10 (0=10), 1d100 (percentile via two d10s) rolls.
* XdY notation: roll X dice of Y sides.

**Attributes & Generation**

* Eleven attributes: Str, Con, Ref, Agi, Dex, Bty, Cha, Int, IQ, Psy, HP.
* Fraction columns: Full, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 (rounded up each halving).
* Standard gen: 1d6×10 per attr; Assign: 10d6×10 assign; Ace: 3d6+1d10×10 assign, others=30; bonus table if 10/20.
* HP from Con table + Str modifier:
Hit Points
Con -> HP
1-25 = 5
26-50 = 10
51-75 = 15
76-100 = 20
Str HP
1-25 = +2
26-50 = +5
51-75 = +10
76-100 = +15
* Carrying: max lift = Str×3.6 kg; carry = Str×2.

**Dice Resolution & Fractional Success**

* Roll 1d100 ≤ column → successes: Full=1, ½=2, ¼=3, ⅛=4.
* Spend successes in order Full→⅛ for effects, extra actions, bursts, armor avoidance, hit location shifts.

**Initiative & Actions**

* Initiative: roll vs Ref; sort by fraction (⅛→¼→½→Full→Fail).
* Actions: 1 per turn + extra per passed fractions + extras (Ambidex, animals).
* Reserve actions or help: can save for others or intervene.

**Skill Checks**

* If untrained: roll vs attribute columns.
* Trained: roll vs attribute Full + skill value.
* Skills ≥30 add +5 to ½,¼,⅛; ≥60 add +10; ≥90 add +15.

**Advantages & Impairments**

* After base roll, roll for each Impairment (GM) subtracts 1 success if % roll ≤ value.
* Player rolls for each Advantage adds 1 success if ≤ value.
* Optional d10 rule when multiples of 10.

**Combat & Damage**

* To hit: 1 success (Full) for single action; bursts use extra successes (1 per 5 ROF).
* Defensive roll: spend actions to roll and remove attacker successes.
* Hit location: roll 1d100 mapping to body zones; critical effects by location.
* Damage: subtract armor (AR); extra successes reduce AR by fractions of weapon damage.
* Stress: Physical (Str/Con/Ref), Functional (Agi/Dex/Cha/Bty), Mental (Int/IQ/Psy). Stress adds to rolls; exceeding attr blocks rolls.
* Injury modifiers: Wounded/HP thresholds impose attr penalties.
* Healing: Con roll per 6 days; medics speed via skill and reduce stress.

**Movement & Hazards**

* Walk: 14 m/turn; run: 50 m base + frac×(Str/5) meters; endurance via Con/Sprinting rolls.
* Jump: base + build bonus + frac×Str (cm).
* Climb/Swim: frac successes grant additional turns before Physical Stress.
* Encumbrance: rolls and penalties when load >Str or >Str×2.
* Hazards (environment, traps, survival): use Challenge Points (CP) reduced by frac successes; random tables.

**Stress & Recovery**

* Types: Physical, Functional, Mental.
* Rest/sleep: Con rolls relieve IP points: full→1, ½→2, ¼→3, ⅛→4.
* Exhaustion/collapse on doubling stress; mental breakdown tables if Mental≥Psy.

**Social & Mental Combat**

* Social conflicts use Cha/Int + related skills; defender rolls IQ/Psy to reduce frac successes.
* Stress inflicted = successes → Mental Stress.
* Principles/Priorities grant immunities or advantages.

**Skills & Focus**

* Each attribute lists skills; values noted as +X.
* Focus skill: every +30 grants a focus ability +5 to ½,¼,⅛.

**Equipment & Items**

* Weapons use WS skills; frac successes shift hit location, avoid armor, extra bursts.
* Grenades: frac successes extend range/precision.
* Tech gear: Computer ops, Defeat Security, programming, ECM/ECCM, sensors, radio, signal triangulation.
* Construction, repair, medical, survival tools give % advantages.
* Armor/force fields: AR & HP per zone; fields regen per round.
* Shields: active generators with HP.

**Vehicles & Mechs**

* Stats: AR, HP, BP, Piloting Mod, Speed, crew/passengers.
* Collisions: formulas using speed/mass; passenger damage ratios.
* Evasive: Pilot rolls reduce attacker successes.
* Sensors/ECM/ECCM: frac successes for locks or countermeasures.
* Critical hits: roll percent ≤ crit chance per zone → system damage via table; spending success chooses outcome.
* Modifications: use CP tech challenges; transforms on success/failure, CP costs for upgrades/repairs.

**Experience & Advancement**

* Exp awards: in-character, cooperation, nonviolence, intellect, bravery, humor, heroism.
* Skill adv: spend 1 XP; gain per IQ & current skill level table.
* Attr adv: spend 3–5 XP; gain per current attr level.

**NPC & Monster Stats**

* Generated via 1d6×10 + modifiers.
* Actions, damage, defenses per frac columns.
* Special abilities/traps use familiar frac and attribute rolls.
