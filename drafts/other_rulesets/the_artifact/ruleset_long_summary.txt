The game uses dice: 1d6s, 1d10s, and 1d100s.

*   **Dice Notation:** The notation "XdY" represents rolling X dice with Y sides each. For example, 3d6 means rolling 3 six-sided dice.

*   **Die 10 (1D10):** A ten-sided die where the zero (0) is counted as ten.

*   **Die 100 (1D100 or Percentile die):** Two d10 of different colors can be rolled to create a d100. One die represents the tens place, and the other represents the ones place.

```text
Dice are an important part of this game and different types of dice are needed to play. Die is the singular form of Dice.
To determine success or failure.

Rolling 1D100:
Roll two ten-sided dice, each yielding a number between one and ten. One die is the tens and the other is the ones. The darker die is the tens and the lighter die is the ones. So if 1D100 is rolled and the dice give a 5 on the dark die and a 3 on the light die the result is 53. A roll of 00 is not zero but one hundred, the highest possible roll. This method will yield any number between one and one hundred, therefore qualifying as a 1D100.
```

- **Attribute Generation (Standard Method):** Roll 1d6 for each attribute (except HP), multiply by 10 (1d6 x 10). Record in the "Full" column.
- **Attribute Generation (Assign Method):** Roll 10d6 and assign each roll to an attribute, multiplying by 10.
- **Attribute Generation (Ace Method):** Roll 3d6 and 1d10, multiply each result by 10, and assign to attributes of choice. Remaining 6 attributes are set to 30. If the 1d10 x 10 results in a 10 or 20, roll twice on bonus table one.
- **Hit Points Calculation:** Based on Constitution and Strength.

| Constitution | Hit Points |
|---|---|
| 1-25 | 5 |
| 26-50 | 10 |
| 51-75 | 15 |
| 76-100 | 20 |

| Strength | Hit Points Modifier |
|---|---|
| 1-25 | +2 |
| 26-50 | +5 |
| 51-75 | +10 |
| 76-100 | +15 |

- **Fraction Column Calculation:**
    - 1/2 column: Full value / 2, round up.
    - 1/4 column: 1/2 column value / 2, round up.
    - 1/8 column: 1/4 column value / 2, round up.

```
NONE
```

*   **Attributes:** Eleven attributes are recorded, and their values are halved repeatedly (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). The 1/2 column is the attribute value rounded up to the nearest whole number. The 1/4 column is half of the 1/2 column value rounded up. The 1/8 column is half of the 1/4 column value rounded up.
*   **Skills:** Skill values are recorded, and each skill is associated with an attribute to be added.
*   **Max Lifting Mass:** Calculated by multiplying the character's strength attribute by 3.6 (result is in kilograms).
*   **Carrying Mass:** Calculated by multiplying the character's strength attribute by 2.

```
The Artifact uses a system of rules to guide gameplay.

The Artifact uses the Fraction Column system. This system has been designed to be consistent throughout so that players can learn a handful of basic concepts and then expand on those concepts as they go.
```

Attributes:
- Ten main attributes: Physical, Functional, and Mental.
Physical:
- Constitution: Toughness and energy reserves. Resists fatigue, disease, stuns, and stress. Deciding factor in Hit Points.
- Strength: Muscle power. Influences moving heavy objects and exerting brute force. A character can lift off the ground 3.6 x their strength in Kilograms.
- Reflex: Reaction time. Used when rushed or pressed for time.
Functional:
- Agility: Physical accuracy. Athletic ability, firing a gun, acrobatics.
- Dexterity:
- Beauty:
- Charisma: Ability to be pleasant and persuasive. Ability to give orders or persuade NPCs, to speak forcefully, and to stir emotion in listeners.

*   **Event Resolution:** Used when a character attempts a task that isn't simple. It tests the character's ability against the difficulty of the task. Tasks that a normal person of the character's age can easily do don't require testing.
*   **Hit Points:** A measure of health, determined by Constitution and Strength attributes. The document provides tables that define how the player should derive their character's Hit Points from Strength and Constitution.

*   **Event Resolution:** Used when a character has a reasonable chance of failure.

*   **Fraction Columns:** Attributes have four fraction column results: Full, Half, Quarter, and Eighth (Full, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8). A player rolls 1d100 and compares the result to these columns. If the roll is equal to or lower than the number in a column, the character has passed that column. Eighth is the best result, followed by Quarter, Half, and then Full.

*   **Play Order:** Determined by rolling for initiative. A combat round lasts 10 seconds.

*   **Initiative:** Players roll against their character's Reflex attribute. Characters that fail are grouped together. The order is Eighth, then Quarter, then Half, then Full, and then Failed rolls. Ties act at the same time. Extra Effort can be used to boost initiative.

*   **Actions:** Each event resolution roll requires an Action. Characters start with one Action per turn and gain additional Actions based on fractional successes from their initiative roll (one Action per passed fraction column). Some effects, such as Ambidextrous, and some animals, add extra actions.

*   **Untrained Ability:** When attempting a task without a specific skill, roll 1d100 and compare the result to the character's attribute fraction columns.

*   **Skill Checks:** Characters can attempt tasks using skills combined with attributes. If a character lacks a specific skill, they can attempt the action using only an attribute roll.
*   **Untrained Skills:** Some skills can be used untrained (skill level +0), while others cannot.
*   **Adding Skill Value:** When using a skill, its value is added to the attribute's "Full" column.
*   **Dice Rolling:** Roll 1d100. Results under fraction column values grant bonuses.
*   **Fraction Column Bonuses:** Skills with a value of 30 or greater add +5 to Half, Quarter, and Eighth fraction columns. Skills of 60+ add +10, and 90+ add +15.
*   **Fractional Successes:**
    *   Full Column: 1 success.
    *   Half Column: 2 successes.
    *   Quarter Column: 3 successes.
    *   Eighth Column: 4 successes.
*   **Spending Successes:** Players state the order in which they spend successes, starting with Full and ending with Eighth.
*   **Challenging Skills:** In character vs character situations, the defender tries to reduce the attacker's successes, removing the smallest fraction successes first.
*   **Role Play Advantage:** Acting out what your character is doing grants a 20% Advantage roll.

- **Bursts of Actions:** Some weapons have a Rate of Fire (ROF) greater than 1. When using such a weapon, a fractional success result allows spending successes, each success corresponding to a fraction of the ROF impacting the target.

- **Defensive Rolls:** A character can use an Action to make a defensive roll when attacked, even if it's not their turn. The defensive roll reduces the attacker's fractional successes. If all fractional successes are removed, the attack is unsuccessful. A successful defensive roll protects against all attacks that turn. Players can use different defensive skills as many times as they have actions once it is their turn.

- **Running:** Running can be used as a defensive roll. The number of fraction columns the Sprinting skill roll is passed by applies to reducing all attacks made on that character for the turn.

- **Impairments and Advantages**: The GM rolls for Impairments and the player rolls for Advantages.

*   **Skill Checks:** Players perform skill checks, the results of which are measured in Fractional Successes.
*   **Impairments:**
    *   Impairments are conditions that hinder a character's actions.
    *   Each impairment has a percentage value.
    *   For each impairment, the GM rolls 1d100.
    *   If the die roll is *lower* than the impairment percentage, one Fractional Success is *subtracted*.
    *   Impairments are rolled for separately; their values are not combined.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Advantages are conditions that help a character's actions.
    *   Each advantage has a percentage value.
    *   The player rolls 1d100.
    *   If the die roll is *lower* than the advantage percentage, one Fractional Success is *added*.
*   **Optional Rule (Impairments):**
    *   If all impairment percentages are multiples of 10, roll 1d10 instead of 1d100 (representing the tens place).
    *   A result *lower* than the impairment percentage subtracts a Fractional Success.
    *   A roll of 0 on the d10 is considered lower than 10%.
    *   Multiple impairments at the same percentage can be rolled for simultaneously using multiple d10s.
*   **Roll Outcomes:** Impairments can cause a roll to fail and an Advantage can cause a failed roll to pass.

*   **Skill Checks:** Players roll against a percentage based on their skill. Failing the initial skill check does not guarantee failure if advantages are present.
*   **Fractional Successes:** Rolls lower than a given percentage (often from advantages or impairments) contribute fractional successes.
*   **Advantages:** Advantages provide a percentage chance for a fractional success.
*   **Advantage Rolls:** Advantage rolls do not cost additional actions, but the original skill check does.
*   **Optional Advantage Rule:** If all advantages are in increments of 10, roll 1d10 representing the tens place. A result lower than the advantage percentage means a fractional success is added. Multiple advantages at the same percentage can be rolled for simultaneously using multiple d10s.
*   **Reserving Actions:** A player may reserve an action until later in a round, after another player's turn, to be used.
*   **Helping Another Character:** Multiple characters can roll under their relevant skill to help another character. The roll with the most fractional successes represents the group's effort.
*   **Intervention:** A character can reserve an action to protect another character who is attacked. This can involve knocking the other character out of harm's way (Strength roll to reduce attacker's fractional successes) or blocking an attack (Parry skill roll with a 40% advantage).

**Overfire:**

*   A character must use an action for every time a weapon is Overfired, after using up initial actions up to the weapon's safe Rate of Fire (ROF).
*   Plasma weapons require a successful Weapon Repair or Artillery Repair roll to disable safety systems before they can be Overfired.
*   Roll a 1D100 each time a gun Overfires. If the roll is equal to or under the listed percentage, roll on the failure table.

    *   Projectile Guns: 10%
    *   Projectile Artillery: 25%
    *   Plasma Guns: 20%
    *   Plasma Artillery: 30%
*   Overfire Failure Table:

    *   1-60: Gun jams, repair roll required.
    *   61-90: Barrel melts, must be replaced.
    *   91-100: Barrel explodes, character or vehicle takes 1D6 x the PB (Penetration Bonus) damage of the weapon.

**Mobbing Actions:**

*   If one force outnumbers another at least five to one, they count as a mob.
*   A mob can make a single Strength based attack. Damage equals the sum of all Strength scores in the mob, divided by 100.
*   If a mob spends an entire turn in contact with an armored object without any other action, they can make a single attack that turn that has an armor piercing effect.
*   The MobΓÇÖs average IQ attribute is rolled against. Fractional successes can be used to avoid armor in a single attack, including Strength based attacks.

**Dynamics (Range):**

*   Numbers are in meters, "K" means thousands (kilometers).
*   Percentage values are Advantage and Impairments when using that range bracket.
*   Human vision has a range class of D; Intuition rolls are modified by distance.
    *   Objects over 500 meters away have a 20% Impairment to notice.
    *   Objects over 1 kilometer away have a 40% Impairment to notice.
    *   Objects over 5 kilometers away have a 90% Impairment to notice.

*   **Range Classes:** Used for ranged weapons and sensors, indicating distance and effectiveness drop-off. Range classes are lettered A-E, with distance brackets (PB, Shrt, Med, L, Ex) and associated distances in meters (e.g., A: PB=1m, Shrt=5m, Med=15m, L=30m, Ex=150m).

*   **Blast Range Classes:** Area effects have blast range classes using the same range brackets as normal range classes.

*   **Running:**

    *   Baseline speed: 50 meters per turn.
    *   Additional distance: For each fractional success on a Strength attribute or Sprinting skill check, the character can run Strength/5 meters more per turn.
    *   Endurance: Roll against Constitution attribute or Running skill check. For each fractional success, the character can run for one turn before taking a Physical Stress point. Failure results in immediately taking a Physical Stress point.

*   **Walking:**

    *   Base speed: 14 meters per turn.
    *   Endurance: Roll against Constitution. For each fractional success, the character can walk 5 kilometers without taking a Physical Stress point.

*   **Jumping:**

    *   Horizontal Jump: Distance is determined by Strength attribute and build (Light, Med, Heavy).
    *   Base distance is added based on build (+100cm for Light, +60cm for Med, +30cm for Heavy).
    *   Additional distance: For every fractional success, the character can jump a number of centimeters equal to their Strength attribute.

*   **Wounds:**
    *   If a character loses half their hit points, their movement speed is halved.
*   **Armor and Area Effects:**
    *   If a character wearing armor is caught in an area effect, all of their armor's hit locations take damage, but the character only takes normal damage if their armor is destroyed.

*   **Jumping:**
    *   Base Jump: Determined by Build (Light, Med, Heavy) with values of +50 cm, +25 cm and +10 cm respectively.
    *   Total Jump: Base Jump + (Strength / 2) in centimeters.
*   **Climbing:**
    *   Climbing speed: Strength \* 5 centimeters per combat turn (10 seconds) for each Fractional Success.
    *   Climbing skill check: Roll against the Climbing skill. For every fractional success, climb for one turn before taking 1 Physical Stress. Failure results in 1 Physical Stress immediately.
*   **Swimming:**
    *   Swimming speed: Strength / 10 meters per turn.
    *   Additional speed: +1 meter per turn for every fractional success.
    *   Endurance Swimming skill check: Roll against the Endurance Swimming skill. For every fractional success, swim for one turn before taking 1 Physical Stress. Failure results in 1 Physical Stress immediately.
*   **Encumbrance:**
    *   Lifting: No Strength roll needed for masses <= Strength in Kilograms.
    *   Lifting skill check: Weight Lifting roll required for masses > Strength in Kilograms. Failure results in 1 Physical Stress.
    *   Maximum Lift: Strength \* 3.6 Kilograms.
    *   Carrying skill check: Constitution roll required for carrying masses > Strength in Kilograms.
    *   Movement penalty: Carrying masses > (Strength \* 2) results in half speed.
    *   Carrying skill check: Roll against the Carrying skill. For every fractional success, carry the load for ten minutes before taking 1 Physical Stress. Failure results in 1 Physical Stress immediately.
*   **Missile Movement:**
    *   Speed: 1250 km/h or 5 km per turn.
    *   Time to Target: 1 turn for every 5 kilometers of distance.
    *   Countermeasures: Missiles can be shot down or dodged each turn in flight.
    *   Course Correction: Attacker can make another artillery operation roll the next turn.
*   **Wielding Mass:**
    *   One-Handed Limit: Strength / 10
    *   Two-Handed Limit: (Strength / 10) \* 2

*   **Carrying Capacity:** Wielding a weapon increases the character's effective wielding mass. If the wielding mass exceeds the character's carrying capacity, the player rolls a Carrying skill check. On a successful roll, the character can carry the load for 1 minute per fractional success before taking a Physical Stress point. A failed roll results in one Physical Stress point immediately.
*   **Stress:** There are three types of stress: Physical, Functional, and Mental.
    *   Physical stress affects Strength, Constitution, and Reflex.
    *   Functional stress affects Agility, Dexterity, Charisma, and Beauty.
    *   Mental stress affects Intuition, IQ, and Psyche.
*   **Stress Points:** Stress points are added to the dice roll value for the associated attributes.
    *   Physical stress adds to rolls for Strength, Constitution, and Reflex.
    *   Functional stress adds to rolls for Agility, Dexterity, Charisma, and Beauty.
    *   Mental stress adds to rolls for Intuition, IQ, and Psyche.
*   **Stress and Attribute Rolls:** If a character's stress of any type is higher than one of the attributes it affects, the character is effectively unable to pass a roll with that attribute. Skills may partially offset this.
*   **Stress from Equipment:** Stress effects from equipment are rated in stress points per hour. For fractional stress points per hour (e.g., 1 in 6), roll a die (e.g., 1d6). On a roll of 1, the character gains a stress point.

- **Food:** Characters need 2.5 meals a day. Not eating enough causes 1 physical stress per day. Scimrahn only needs 1.5 meals per day. For each 0.5 meal over 2.5, relieve 1 physical stress. For each 0.5 meal over 3 (2.5 for Scimrahn), make a Constitution roll or be unable to eat more.
- **Extra Effort:** Before or after an important roll, a character can reduce their roll result by 5 per stress point taken, applying the stress to the attribute related to the roll after it is completed.
- **Sleep:** Each hour of sleep relieves one point of each kind of stress. After, the player rolls for the character's Constitution. For each fractional success, one more point of each kind of stress is relieved.
- **Resting:** Resting involves a Constitution roll. A Full result relieves 1 point of Physical and Functional Stress. A 1/2 result relieves 2 points, a 1/4 result relieves 3 points, and a 1/8 result relieves 4 points of each.
- **Death of a Hero:** When a PC dies, other characters take stress points (any type, any number), pooled to form a starting experience point bonus for the new character. The GM may limit this bonus.
- **Simplified Stress for NPCs:** For non-vital NPCs or large groups, the GM may use a single generic Stress value.

*   **Stress:** Characters have Physical stress (equal to Constitution), Functional stress (equal to Agility), and Mental stress (equal to Psyche).
*   **Exhaustion:** Exceeding Physical or Functional stress results in exhaustion, requiring rest.
*   **Constitution Roll:** Exhausted characters must make a Constitution roll each turn or collapse (can use extra effort).
*   **Stress Damage:** If Physical or Functional stress doubles the attribute, the character takes 1 damage per additional stress point.
*   **Mental Breakdown:** Exceeding Mental stress leads to mental breakdown.
*   **Suicidal Tendencies:** Character must make a Psyche roll each day or become suicidal. A suicidal character must make a Psyche roll when alone; failure results in a suicide attempt unless someone intervenes.
*   **Disorders Table:** If Mental stress doubles the Psyche attribute, roll 1d100 on the Disorders table (Psychosomatic Disease, Neuroses, Psychosis).
*   **Disease Tables:** If Psychosomatic Disease is rolled on the Disorders table, roll 1d100 on the psychosomatic disease table. If Neuroses is rolled on the Disorders table, roll 1d100 on the Neurosis table. If Psychosis is rolled on the Disorders table, roll 1d100 on the Psychosis table.
*   **Headache:** 20% Impairment to IQ, Int, and Psy rolls. Untreated for 1d6 weeks turns into a disabling migraine (-40% Impairment to all rolls)
*   **Acid Indigestion:** 20% Impairment to Con, Str, and Ref. Untreated for 1d10 weeks causes -1 Hit Point per month (ignore normal healing).
*   **High Blood Pressure:** If left untreated for 1d10 months, the character may have a heart attack (Con roll, 2d10 damage if failed).
*   **Diarrhea:** 20% Impairment to Con, Str and Ref. May lead to cirrhosis of the intestine after 1d10 months. (-1 Hit point per month ignore normal healing)
*   **Anorexia:** 3 Physical Stress per day. -1 Hit Point per month (ignore normal healing).
*   **Nervous Rash:** 20% Impairment to Con rolls. Can lead to scaring and permanent damage to the skin after 1d10 weeks. (-10 from Bty)
*   **Sleeplessness:** Cannot relive stress with sleep.
*   **Anxiety:** 4 mental stress per day.

- **Conversion Disorder:** When stress points are inflicted, roll 1D10:
    - 1-2: Blindness (50% impairment to Int)
    - 3-4: Deafness (40% impairment to Int)
    - 5-6: Paralysis (80% impairment to Agi)
    - 7-8: Mute (60% impairment to Cha and Language skills)
    - 9-10: Touch (40% impairment to Dex and Agi)
- **Obsessive Compulsion:** Character becomes locked in a behavior until they can pass a Psyche check.
- **Phobic:** Character takes a stress point for each turn exposed to the stimulus and must make a Psy roll or must flee the stimulus.
- **Bi-Polar:** Roll 1D10 every day:
    - 1-5: Manic (40% Advantage to Ref)
    - 6-10: Depressed (Impairment for Ref, Int, IQ, and Psy)
- **M.P.D:** Each time the character is subjected to one stress point, the current personality drops back into his sub-conscience and a new one emerges. If more than one stress point is induced the change of personalities is so disorientating, that the M.P.D. is incapacitated for 1d6x10 minutes. Roll a die ten to determine the number of personalities. Each personality has its own mental attributes (IQ, Int, Cha, Psy).
- **Psychosis:** The GM may apply the impairment level to tasks that would apply to the specific Psychosis. Roll 1d10:
    - 1-3: Mild (30% Impairment)
    - 4-6: Disabling (60% Impairment)
    - 7-10: Life threatening (90% Impairment)
- **Schizophrenia:** Roll 1d10:
    - 1-3: Simple (Impairments usually apply to Reflex and IQ rolls)
    - 4-7: Disorganized (Impairments most often apply to Intuition, IQ and Psyche rolls)
    - 8-10: Paranoid (Impairments most often apply to Charisma and Psyche rolls)
- **Catatonic:** Impairments apply to Agility, Reflex, Strength and Dexterity rolls.

```
Hit Points (HP): Represents the amount of damage a person or object can take. When HP is reduced to zero (0), the person dies or the object is destroyed.

Armor Rating (AR): Represents the resistance to damage of armored materials. The AR remains constant until the Hit Points of the object are reduced to zero. Fractional Successes can be spent to reduce the effect of armor.

Hit Location:
Head
R Shoulder
L Shoulder
Body
R Arm
Leg

Damage: When a person or object is damaged, their Hit Points are reduced.
```

```
Hit location AR: Determines where damage is applied. The body is divided into eight areas affecting damage and stress. Head hits do double damage; arm and leg hits do half damage.

Armor: Absorbs damage up to its rating. Exceeding the rating still reduces total damage by the armor value.

Modifiers:
*   Wounded (half HP): -20 to all attributes
*   Wounded (1 HP): -5 Str, -5 Agi
*   1 drink alcohol: -5 Ref, -5 IQ, -5 INT

Here's a summary of the core game mechanics extracted from the text:

**Skill Advancement:**

*   The rate at which a character raises skills is dependent on their Intelligence Quotient (I.Q.).
*   Find the character's I.Q. on a chart, along with their current skill level.
*   This information provides a ratio of skill points gained per experience point expended.
*   One Experience point raises skill level based on I.Q. and Current Skill Level.

**Experience Points:**

*   Experience points are awarded for:
    *   Avoiding unnecessary violence (+1).
    *   Using their head (+2).
    *   Co-operating (+1).
    *   Good humor (+1).
    *   Bravery or heroism (+2).
    *   Being good or noble (+1).

**Movement:**

*   Movement is measured in meters per turn and kilometers per hour (km/h).
*   Speeds provided: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 Km/h

**Combat/Damage:**

*   **Hand-to-Hand Damage:** Damage is based on character Strength (Str+).
    *   10-40: 1 point
    *   41-60: 2 points
    *   61-80: 3 points
    *   81-100: 4 points
    *   101-120: 5 points
*   **Hit Location:** Determined by rolling 1D100 (one 100-sided die).
    *   0-2: Foot
    *   41-47: Left Arm
    *   55-74: Body
    *   89-100: Head

**Ranks:**
* Advancement is required at specific experience point ranges.
* Private: 3-7 Exp.
* Corporal: 8-20 Exp.
* Sergeant: 21-50 Exp.
* Staff: 51-100 Exp.

*   **Hand-to-Hand Damage (HTH):** Damage is calculated based on points ranging from 1 to 7, potentially involving Strength ("Str+").

    *   1 point: 10-40
    *   2 points: 41-60
    *   3 points: 61-80
    *   4 points: 81-100
    *   5 points: 101-120
    *   6 points: 121-130
    *   7 points: 131-140
*   **Critical Hits:**

    *   Head: Damage x2
    *   Shoulder: -1 HP/min to bloodloss
    *   Arm: 1/2 Damage Str-15 Dex-20
    *   Hand: 1/4 Damage Str-5 Dex-20
    *   Groin: Incapacitation 1d10 turns, -1 HP/turn to bloodloss
    *   Leg: 1/2 Damage Str-20 Agi-10
    *   Foot: 1/4 Damage Str-10 Agi-10
*   **Range Classes:**  Used for weapons and sensors. Longer ranges have negative modifiers.
    *   Range: Shrt Med Long Ex PB
*   **Attack Resolution:** A fractional success indicates a hit.
*   **Impairment:** 20% Imp, 40% Imp, 90% Imp.

- **Dice Rolls:** 1d10
- **Range Classes:** Used in weapons and sensors. Longer ranges have negative modifiers due to increasing difficulty.
- **Hit Location:** Fractional successes after the first allow moving a hit to a different location.
- **Armor:** Fractional successes after the first allow avoiding armor, reducing the Armor Rating (AR) by one half the weapon's damage.
- **Bursts:** Each fractional success after the first allows hitting one more time for every five attacks.
- **Damage:** Certain hit locations (Foot, Leg) receive reduced damage and inflict penalties to Strength and Agility.
- **Bloodloss:** Some attacks may cause bloodloss, resulting in HP loss per turn.

```
HTH: Hand-to-hand combat.

Combat Resolution:

Damage is calculated based on a range (e.g., 141-150), resulting in a point value (e.g., 8 points).

Damage may be modified by "Str+".

Attribute Checks:

Attribute Advancement:
Attribute advancement is not dependent on I.Q. only the current attribute level applies. A minimum of 3 experience points must be expended.
```

```
Skill Advancement:

The rate a character raises a skill depends on their I.Q.
Find the character's I.Q. and current skill level on the chart to determine the ratio of skill points raised per experience point (Exp) spent.

Attribute Advancement:

Attribute advancement is not dependent on I.Q., only the current attribute level.
A minimum of 5 Exp must be spent to raise an attribute.
```

```text
*   **Attribute Advancement:**

    *   A minimum of 5 Exp must be spent to raise an attribute.
    *   Attribute advancement is not dependent on I.Q., only the current attribute level.
    *   Attribute Level: 10-30, 31-60, 61-99
    *   Advancement Cost:
        *   5 Exp +5
        *   +3
        *   +1
*   **Hit Locations:**
    *   Head: Damage x2, 10 Physical
    *   Body: Standard Damage, 10 Mental
    *   Shoulder: Standard Damage, 10 Physical
    *   Arm: 5 Functional Damage, 5 Physical
    *   Hand: Half Damage, 3 Functional
    *   Groin: 5 Physical
    *   Leg: 10 Functional Quarter Damage, 15 Physical
    *   Foot: Half Damage
*   **Targeting Specific Hit Locations:**
    *   When a character attacks, it's assumed to be aimed at the center mass.
    *   By spending a fraction success, the attacker can move one hit location.
    *   Possible Location Changes (spending a fraction success):
        *   Head to Body
        *   Body to Head, Shoulder, or Groin
        *   Shoulder to Body or Arm
        *   Arm to Shoulder or Hand
        *   Hand to Arm
        *   Groin to Body or Leg
        *   Leg to Groin or Foot
        *   Foot to Leg
*   **Avoiding Armor:**
    *   A player may spend a fraction success on avoiding armor.
    *   For each success spent, the Armor Rating (AR) is reduced:
        *   1 success: AR reduced by one half the damage of the weapon (rounded down).
        *   2 successes: AR reduced by the full damage of the weapon.
        *   3 successes: AR reduced by one and a half times the weapon damage (maximum).
    *   The first success must be spent to hit the target.
```

*   **Combat Resolution:**
    *   Attacker rolls to hit. Success determines if the attack hits, and potentially other effects like avoiding armor.
    *   Hit location is determined randomly.
    *   Damage is calculated based on the weapon and range.
    *   Armor reduces damage. The first points of damage ignore armor equal to half damage.
    *   Remaining damage is reduced by the armor rating (AR).
*   **Stress and Stun:**
    *   Taking damage applies a stress effect.
    *   A Constitution roll is made after taking damage.
    *   If the Constitution roll fails, the character is stunned, reducing their Actions by 2 for the next turn.
*   **Incapacitation:**
    *   If a character loses more than half their HP and fails a Constitution roll, they are incapacitated.
    *   Incapacitated characters cannot take actions for 2d10 turns.
*   **Healing:**
    *   Characters can attempt to heal every six days by making a Constitution roll.
    *   Each fractional success heals one HP.
    *   Quality care (successful medicine skill roll) reduces Physical stress and the time between healing rolls.
*   **Force Fields:**
    *   Force fields have hit points.
    *   Attacks deplete force field hit points before damaging what they protect.
    *   Force fields regenerate hit points fully at the beginning of each round, unless the shield generator is critically damaged.
    *   Force fields cover one fire arc per active shield.

*   **Healing:** A medic rolls a "Full" column to allow a patient to roll against their Constitution after five days of healing. The patient rolls their "Full" column and heals one point.
*   **Ion Cascade Shields:** Touching a force field causes damage equal to the field's hit points divided by 100.
*   **Avoiding Shields:** Fractional successes can be used to avoid shields. One fractional success cuts the shield's strength in half. A second fractional success circumvents the shield entirely.
*   **Material Damage:** Armor Rating (AR) and Hit Points (HP) are defined for various materials, measured per centimeter (cm). Examples: hex walls (AR 10, HP 10/cm), light plastics (AR 2, HP 1/cm), plastics (AR 1, HP 2/cm), industrial plastics (AR 4, HP 4/cm), super hard plastics (AR 5, HP 5/cm), dirt/earthworks (AR 0, HP 5/cm), brick/stone (AR 3, HP 1/cm), iron (AR 7, HP 10/cm), mild steel (AR 8, HP 10/cm), hardened steel (AR 15, HP 12/cm), armor alloys (AR 30, HP 15/cm).
*   **Unarmed Combat:**
    *   To hit, a character rolls against their Agility attribute plus any applicable skills (HTH Combat, Martial Arts, Street Fighting).
    *   Damage: A character inflicts physical stress equal to their Strength attribute divided by five for each fractional success rolled under in the Agility roll. Every ten points of Physical stress inflicts one point of damage.
*   **Avoiding Death:**
    *   The player rolls 1D10.
    *   The rolled number determines how far down the attribute list (CON to PSY) to count. That attribute is permanently reduced by a value determined by a 1D6x5 roll.
    *   If any attribute hits zero, the character dies.
    *   Even if saved, the character is incapacitated until a successful surgery roll is made.

- Social Conflict occurs when a character tries to change how another character thinks or feels.
- Attributes used are Beauty, Charisma, IQ, and Psyche. Skills include Bartering, Bluffing, Command, Intimidation, Persuasion, Politics, Propaganda, Resist Intimidation, Seduction, and Sociology.
- The influencing character rolls against IQ (fact-based) or Charisma (value-based), adding applicable skills to the roll and summing Fraction Successes.
- The defending character can reduce Fraction Successes by rolling against IQ. The fraction column passed is the amount of reduction.
- The defending character can also roll against Psyche and skills like Resist Intimidation.
- Each roll requires an Action. IQ and Psyche defense rolls can be made on separate turns.
- Each remaining Fraction Success inflicts one Mental Stress point.
- Stalling an argument inflicts 5 Mental Stress points, plus additional Mental Stress per hour of seeing the opposing person. Each subsequent stall increases the hourly Mental Stress.

Surrender:

A losing character admits defeat and complies with the other character's influence. The losing character relieves half the stress they accumulated, while the winner relieves all stress built up in the argument.

Aggression:

A losing character whose stress exceeds their IQ or Psyche may react with physical aggression.

Principles:

If an idea goes against a character's nature, the player may declare the character immune to arguments by explaining the principle at stake. This principle must be core to the character and recorded on the character sheet. Violating this principle later results in 50 Mental Stress points, as determined by the GM.

Priorities:

Priorities are important to the character, but not as strongly as principles. A player may declare that a priority of the character's effects the social conflict and gets a 40% Advantage to the skill that they use to attack or defend in the conflict when this subject is at stake. A character can have up to three priorities. Taking stress while using a priority results in twice the normal amount of stress.

Beauty:

The beauty attribute can be rolled for, and the Fraction Successes are used to reduce the other characterΓÇÖs Psyche defense.

- Skill checks: Roll for a skill (e.g., Persuasion) and associated attribute (e.g., Charisma).
- Social conflict: Characters can use social conflict skills to draw attention. Failure to defend results in stress unless the character surrenders.
- NPC handling: GM decides NPC response to stress in social conflict, considering consequences. NPCs may surrender or resist based on the situation.
- Mental combat: Priests and Kelecs use IQ or Charisma for the first roll and can boost fractional successes with a Psyche roll. The defender uses IQ or Charisma to defend first and adds a second roll of Psyche to defend against the attackerΓÇÖs will.

*   **Challenge Points (CP):** Environments have CP, representing the effort to overcome them.

*   **CP Reduction:** Players roll against skills/attributes to reduce CP. Each character reduces CP individually to zero to complete the challenge. Characters can share up to half of their Fractional Successes with another character.

*   **Surmounting Attribute:** Each turn roll against the surmounting attribute and compare the result to the chart to see how many CP are reduced.

*   **Hazards:** Environments present randomly generated hazards. The GM chooses hazards or rolls for them.

*   **Dehydration Hazard:** Every survival round, characters face dehydration. Defend by drinking 1/2 liter of water. Failure results in 2 Physical Stress per turn. Stress accumulates until recovery. Physical Stress exceeding Con results in 1 point of damage per round.

*   **Exertion Hazard:** Every survival round, characters face exertion. While walking, they take 2 Physical Stress unless they drink another 1/2 liter of water or make a successful Con roll. Stress accumulates until recovery. Physical Stress exceeding Con results in 1 point of damage per round.

*   **Random Hazards:** GM rolls 1D100 on a table to determine random hazards:

    *   **Blowing Wind:** Characters without wind protection take 1D6 Physical Stress.

    *   **Mental Stress:** The boredom is getting to the characters, they take 2 Mental Stress points and must make a successful Psyche roll or they cannot travel.

*   **Stress:** Physical Stress is accumulated due to environmental factors and exertion. Exceeding the character's Con score while climbing leads to a potential fall if another Strength roll is failed.
*   **Dice Rolls:**
    *   Roll 2D6 and add to remaining CP (Context: lost direction).
    *   Roll 1D100 for random hazards during survival rounds.
    *   Damage from falling rocks is 1D6.
*   **Skill Checks/Attribute Tests:**
    *   Agility roll required to recover from loose rock or exertion hazard. Failure results in 2 Physical Stress.
    *   Strength roll required to climb. Failed Strength rolls during climbing lead to exertion hazard.
    *   Strength roll to move up or down with 1d6 10% Impairments (due to stretch between holds or wet rock/moss).
*   **Hazards:**

- Tech challenges are assigned a number of Challenge Points (CP). For a game-long challenge, assign 6-10 CP per technical character; for an end-of-game challenge, assign 3-5 CP per technical character.
- To diagnose the problem, characters roll against their skills.
- Fractional successes of the skill roll become the target number.
- If a player describes how a skill applies to the challenge, add 3 to the target number.
- The GM rolls 1d10 out of view. If the roll is equal to or lower than the target number, the skill can be used to defeat the challenge.
- A roll of 1 means the skill reduces Challenge Points at double the normal rate.
- A roll of 10 means it is a red herring. It looks like it will work but will actually set the characters back by adding 3 CP to the challenge if a fix is rolled for.

- Characters roll against a skill to reduce Challenge Points (CP).
- The number of CP reduced is equal to the fraction of successes on the roll.
- Every roll (successful or not) to fix the problem transforms the challenge.
- Successful rolls trigger the "Successful Transform" table (roll 1d6).
- Rolls other than probe rolls that fail to remove CP trigger the "Failure Transform" table (roll 1d10).
- Failure Transform table:
    -Result 4 & 5: Injured characters take 1d10 damage if they fail a Reflex saving roll. Characters gain a 1% Advantage on the roll for every minute the turn took in-game.
    -Result 7: An NPC takes 2d10 damage if they fail a Reflex roll.

- **Fix Attempts:** Attempting to fix something requires a roll. The Game Master (GM) decides how long these attempts take. The frequency of rolls depends on the game's pacing (e.g., one roll per hour in survival situations).

- **Primary Skill Challenges:** Some challenges have a primary skill that works at the beginning without a skill probe test. If a transform says it won't work, other skills are tested with a skill probe until an effective skill is found. Only one roll with the other skill is needed before the primary skill is effective again.

- **Radio Transmission:** Each fractional success on a radio transmission roll allows the transmission to overcome an obstacle, such as a hex wall or an electrically charged atmosphere.

*   **Computer Operation Roll:** Used to detect software probes on the network. Success reveals the location of the probes.

*   **Computer Programming Roll:** Required to send messages across the network. One roll is needed for every 1000 km of distance to the destination computer. A successful roll allows communication for five minutes, after which another roll is required. Also used to check for Chezbah Priest activity along the message path.

*   **Chezbah Priest Detection:** Before a Computer Programming roll, the GM rolls 1D100 for every 1000 km. On a roll of 15 or lower in Chezbah territory, or 5 or lower in Kelrath/open territory, a Chezbah Priest is present. Players may use a Navigation Subterranean roll to determine if the message travels through Chezbah territory.

*   **Computer Security (Barrier Points):** Software and encrypted signals have Barrier Points, representing the time/effort required to bypass security.

*   **Defeat Security Skill:** Can be used to reduce Barrier Points. Reducing Barrier Points to zero grants full computer access.

*   **Hacking:** Hacking a computer is a Primary Skill Tech Challenge using the Defeat Security skill.

- **Hacking:**
    - Skills are used to hack systems.
    - For each Fractional Success on a skill roll, subtract 1 from the system's Barrier Points (BP).
    - Each turn of hacking takes 15 minutes.
    - Roll 1d6 on a successful transform table.
    - Roll 1d10 on a failure transform table.

- **Computer Programming:**
    - Can be used to restore BP to a system.
    - In a 15-minute turn, each fractional success restores a computer's Barrier Points by 1.

- **Code Cracking:**
    - A character can roll under their code cracking skill once every 15 minutes.
    - Each Fractional Success reduces the Barrier Points of a code by one.
    - After 15 minutes, the result of the roll is checked against the appropriate transform table.
    - Roll 1d6 on a successful transform table.

- **Dice Rolls:**
    - d6 is used for various results on success and failure tables.
    - 2d10 are rolled to determine communicators bricked.
- **Skill Checks:**
    - Computer Operation skill roll is required in certain situations.
- **Challenge Points:**
    - Scrambling a signal is a Primary Skill Tech Challenge.
    - For every 10 communicators needing a new encryption scheme, the task has a Challenge Point rating of one.
    - Fractional Success reduces Challenge Points by one.
- **Failure Transform:**
    - Roll 1d6 for results on failure.
- **Successful Transform:**
    - Roll 1d6 for results on success.
- **Vehicle Rules:**
    - Vehicles follow the same rules as in personal combat, with special rules for size and maneuverability.
    - Damage cannot be higher than the lowest Hit Points of the vehicles. Damage is applied to both vehicles.

*   **Vehicle Collisions:**
    *   **Head On:** `Damage = (Speed_Vehicle1 + Speed_Vehicle2) * (Mass_Vehicle1 + Mass_Vehicle2) / 5000`. Damage cannot exceed the lowest Hit Points of either vehicle. Damage is applied to both vehicles.
    *   **Sideswipe:** `Damage = Mass_Smaller_Vehicle / 100`.
    *   **Hit From Behind:** `Damage = ABS(Speed_Vehicle1 - Speed_Vehicle2) * (Mass_Vehicle1 + Mass_Vehicle2) / 5000`. Damage cannot exceed the lowest Hit Points of either vehicle. Damage is applied to both vehicles.
*   **Passenger Damage:**
    *   Unrestrained: 1 damage point per 10 damage the vehicle takes.
    *   Restrained: 1 damage point per 100 damage the vehicle takes.
*   **Evasive Maneuvers:**
    *   Roll against Pilot skill (vehicle must be moving at least 90 Km/h).
    *   For each fractional column passed, reduce one fractional success of an attacker by one.
*   **Fuel Efficiency:**
    *   Roll against Piloting skill.
    *   For each Fractional Success, the vehicle can travel 5% further.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Fractional success grants a general sense of the area.
    *   Fractional success can lock on to a target and identify it (one target per fractional success).
    *   Targeting information from sensor lock can be used with the Artillery Operation skill.
*   **Sensor Range Modifier:**
    | Range Bracket | Sensor Modifier |
    | :------------ | :-------------- |
    | PB            | 20% Imp         |
    | Short         | 20% Adv         |
    | Med           | 40% Imp         |
    | Long          | 90% Imp         |
*   **Running Quiet:**
    *   Roll against Pilot skill to be harder to detect on sensors.
    *   For each fraction column passed, reduce one fractional success.

- ECM skill reduces fractional successes of Artillery Operation by the number of fraction columns passed.
- Successful ECM roll causes sensors to lose lock on a vehicle.
- ECCM fractional successes add to Artillery Operation successes to offset ECM reduction.
- When a vehicle takes damage to Hit Points, the attacker rolls for a critical hit, first determining the fire arc the vehicle was hit from.
- For each Fractional Success used, the attacker can choose the result of each step in determining a critical hit.

```text
Generic Vehicle Critical Hits:

Vehicles with no specific hit locations listed have a critical percentage of 40%.

1.  Roll for the critical percentage (40%) to see if a system has been damaged.
2.  Roll on a chart to see what system was damaged.
3.  If a system is damaged, follow the description of the critical hitΓÇÖs effect.

Vehicle Critical Hits (General):

Step 2: Critical Percentage

1.  Roll 1d100.
2.  If the die value is equal to or lower than the critical percentage of the hit location, a system is damaged; proceed to step 3.
3.  If the die value is higher than the critical percentage, only Hit Point damage is done.
4.  Spending a Fractional Success allows bypassing this step and moving to step 3.

Step 3: System Damage

1.  Roll against the table under the hit location to see which system is affected.
2.  Follow the effect listed for the system.
3.  Spending a Fractional Success allows choosing the system that is damaged.

Drive Hit:

*   Roll 1d10. Speed cut in half.

Passengers Hit:

*   Roll 1d10. Loss of passengers equal to damage/100.

Systems:

*   Roll 1d10. Loss of one of the following systems. If the vehicle does not have the system rolled for, roll again.
    *   1-2 ECMs
    *   3-4 Sensors
    *   5-6 Shields
    *   7-8 Communication
    *   9-10 Weapon

Control:

*   Roll 1d10. The vehicle gets a 20% Impairment to the pilot for every 50 points of damage done by the attack.

Fuel:

*   Roll 1d10. Cut the fuel capacity of the vehicle in half.

Infectious Disease:

Determining Disease Infection:

Step 1: Exposure Check

*   Check if the character ate uncooked food, drank untreated water, was wounded without sterilization, or was exposed to another infectious character.
*   There is a 10% chance of another cause. Roll 1d100. If the roll is lower than 10, the character was exposed.
```

- **Disease Origin:** Roll 1d10. 1-3: Earth origin. 4-10: Artifact origin.
- **Disease Infectiousness:** If the disease is not from the character's native planet, the character gets a 40% Impairment to save vs. disease. Artifact native characters can have this reduced to 10% if they have been immunized by a character with the immunization skill. Roll 1d100 to determine the exact Impairment or Advantage:
    - 1-15: 60% Impairment
    - 16-30: 40% Impairment
    - 31-45: 20% Impairment
    - 46-60: No Impairment
    - 61-70: 20% Advantage
    - 71-80: 40% Advantage
    - 81-90: 60% Advantage
    - 91-100: 80% Advantage
- **Immune System:** If the character has the "Strong Immune System" bonus, that is added to the player's Constitution. Roll vs. Con to see how well the characterΓÇÖs immune system deals with the disease. Roll for any Impairments or Advantages and adjust the number of Fractional Successes.
- **Effect of the Disease:** Roll 1d10 to see how many stress points the disease causes per day.
    - 1: 5
    - 2: 10
    - 3: 20
    - 4-5: 30
    - 6-7: 40
    - 8: 50
    - 9: 60
    - 10: 70
Each Fractional success the character got when rolling for Con, reduces the effect of the disease by 5 stress points.
- **Stress Type:** Roll 1d10 to determine the type of stress.
    - 1-3: 10 Physical
    - 4-6: 10 Functional
    - 7-10: 10 Mental
Assign up to ten of the total stress caused per roll. Stop rolling once there are no more stress points to assign.
- **Constitution Roll:** The Player rolls vs. Con plus or minus immunity Impairments and Advantages that were determined above once every 3 days. If the roll is successful, the character recovers and reduces the daily stress by five for each Fractional Success. Only once the player has reduced the daily stress to zero (0) the disease is cured. If the character is incapable of passing this Constitution roll because of accumulated stress they take 1 point of damage from their Hit Points.
- **Treatment:** If the character is being treated by a character with the General Medicine skill, the daily stress and disease infectiousness Impairment percentages are halved. General medicine must be rolled every 3 days.

*   **Fame Points:** Act like a Charisma Advantage among allies. The number of fame points is the chance strangers will recognize the character. One Fame Point equals a 1 percent chance a person will recognize their name and heard stories.
    *   Add to Charisma skills for allied characters.
    *   Act as an impairment for Charisma skills for enemies.
    *   If Fame Points are used to enhance a Charisma roll and the roll fails, the character loses a fame point.

*   **Gaining Fame Points through Storytelling:** When the characters get back to a base or a tribe from an adventure, they have a chance to tell about it. Players should identify the things they did that will gain them fame. Only one PC can tell the story for the group. Using this skill in a new community gives the PCs one fame point per fractional success. The player of the story teller gets to assign the points to the PCs in the group.
    *   **Failure:** If the story teller fails their roll, the listeners will challenge the story. If the challenge is successfully answered, the character has one more chance to make a Charisma roll and gets 1 fame point if successful. If the challenge is failed, the character looses a fame point.

*   **Word Spreads:** The GM may give the Characters fame points for impressive, heroic, or noble deeds that NPCs would have been able to notice. Unless an extreme situation this should be one Fame Point at a time.

*   **Saving a Life:** Saving someoneΓÇÖs life will get the character a Fame Point once that person starts telling the story. Saving more than one person in a single game can only get up to four Fame Points. Saving children or innocents gets double the Fame Points and can go up to six points per game.

*   **Capturing/Defeating a Famous Person:** If a Character defeats a famous person whether in combat or in a contest in their specialty for the first time gets the character three quarters (75%) of that personΓÇÖs fame. And drop that personΓÇÖs fame by half (50%). This defeat must be in that personΓÇÖs specialty or no fame is gained.

*   **Crime Points:** Crime Points operate similarly to Fame Points but Crime Points can only be used to modify Intimidation and Command Skills.

```text
Experience

Experience points are "spent" like money to "buy" higher skill levels and attributes. At the end of a game the GM awards experience according to the following criteria.

*   Staying in character: 2 experience points.
*   Cooperating with the GM: 2 experience points.
*   Finding solutions using intellect: 1 experience point.
*   Avoiding violence: 1 experience point.
*   Acting good/noble: 1 experience point.
*   Displaying bravery/heroic conduct: 2 experience points.
*   Lightening the mood with humor: 1 experience point.

Training

For every 40 hours of training, a character gets one experience point, which must immediately go into the skill being trained in. The student cannot get a skill level higher than their trainer.

Advancement

Skill Advancement

The rate that a character raises skill levels is dependent on the I.Q. attribute.

*   IQ 10-24: +3 (1-25), +2 (26-50), +1 (51-100)
*   IQ 25-40: +5 (1-25), +3 (26-50), +1 (51-100)
*   IQ 41-75: +8 (1-25), +5 (26-50), +2 (51-100)
*   IQ 76-90: +10 (1-25), +8 (26-50), +5 (51-100)
*   IQ 91-100: +15 (1-25), +10 (26-50), +5 (51-100)

Attribute Advancement

Attribute advancement is not dependent on I.Q., only the current attribute level applies. A minimum of 3 experience points must be expended to raise an attribute.

*   Attribute Level 1-30: +3
*   Attribute Level 31-60: +2
*   Attribute Level 61-100: +1

Infantry Combat

Ace squads add 10 to their Psyche and 10 to their Reflex.

Veteran Squads add 20 to their Psyche and Reflex.
```

*   **Initiative:** Infantry groups roll against their Reflex to determine initiative. The result determines the order in which they act: Eighth, Quarter, Half, Full, then Failed. Ties act simultaneously. Fractional success on the initiative roll grants additional actions.

*   **Actions:** Infantry groups receive one action per turn, plus bonus actions based on their initiative roll. These actions can be used for attack or defense.

*   **Attacks:** Infantry groups do not roll to hit. Instead, weapons have a pre-set number of hits at each range. The player selects a weapon to use for each action, but each weapon can only be used once per turn.

*   **Damage Calculation:**
    1.  Select a weapon.
    2.  Determine the range to the target.
    3.  Consult the weapon's range class chart to find the damage at that range.
    4.  Subtract the target's Armor Rating (AR) from the damage.
    5.  Multiply the remaining damage by the number of Hits listed for the weapon. The result is the total damage done.

*   **Attacks Mechanic:** Weapons have a maximum number of hits per turn. The number of hits cannot be exceeded even with bonuses. The second number is the number of times this attack can be used.

*   **Squad and Larger Group Scaling:**
    *   Standard squad size: 10 men.
    *   Larger groups: Multiply the number in the unit (10) by a multiplier.
    *   Adjustments: Multiply Hit Points (HP), the number of hits per weapon, and the number of HP required for a Stress Point by the same multiplier.

- **Attacks:** A unit can make a specific number of attacks, and this number decreases each time an attack is used.
- **Scout Assistance:** A player rolls against the scout's WS Gun skill plus their Agility to assist infantry fire. The result from a fraction column determines the bonus to the infantry's Hits.
  - Fail: -5 Hits
  - Full: +2 Hits
  - 1/2: +4 Hits
  - 1/4: +8 Hits
  - 1/8: +16 Hits
- **Communications Officer Assistance:** A player rolls against the comm officer's Signal Triangulation skill plus their IQ to assist mechanized infantry and rocket attacks. The result from a fraction column determines the bonus to the infantry's Hits.
  - Fail: -2 Hits
  - Full: +2 Hits
  - 1/2: +3 Hits
  - 1/4: +4 Hits
  - 1/8: +5 Hits
- **Individual vs. Infantry:** When a character gets a fraction column bonus, they may do 20% more damage. This damage bonus can be stacked for every fraction column bonus.
- **Infantry Defensive Actions:** Defensive actions are represented as a ratio of attacks made vs. attacks defended against (e.g., 3 in 10). Multiple actions spent on defense add to the number of attacks defended (e.g., 3+3 in 10 = 6 in 10).
- **Infantry Stress:** Squads take Stress Points in addition to damage. Stress adds to Psyche rolls. Whenever a squad takes a stress point, they roll against their Psy or panic.
    - Every 20 HP damage taken by infantry = 1 stress point.
    - Every 300 HP damage taken by mechanized infantry = 1 stress point.
    - Ambush = 1 stress point
    - Blocked retreat path = 1 stress point.

- **Hit Protection (Duck and Cover):** Some actions like "Duck and Cover" provide a chance to negate hits. For example, "3 in 10" means for every 10 hits, 3 are negated. If "Duck and Cover" is performed twice, it could become "6 in 10," meaning 6 out of every 10 hits are negated.
- **Individual vs. Infantry:** When a character attacks a squad that has used a defensive action, roll against the squadΓÇÖs Reflex attribute as a dodge roll. Make one roll per defensive action used.
- **Large Force Stress:** A squad attacked by a force twice its size takes a stress point.
- **Mechanized Infantry Stress:** A squad attacked by mechanized infantry takes a stress point.
- **Command Skill Roll:** If a squad fails a Psy roll and a commanding officer can communicate with them, the officer can make a Command skill roll to break the squad's panic.
- **Casualties:** HP listed for a squad is half the total HP of individual NPCs in the group. When the squad's HP reaches zero, survivors must be rescued.
- **Rescuing Survivors:** If another unit moves to the location of a defeated squad, roll on a table to determine the number of Healthy, Wounded, and Incapacitated survivors.
- **Healing:** Wounded characters require 20 days of bed rest and medical attention to heal. Incapacitated characters require a successful surgery skill check and 40 days of bed rest.
- **Stress Reduction:** Rescuing wounded NPCs reduces stress points.

Combat Resolution:

*   **Damage and Hits:** Weapons inflict damage and hits, with values varying based on range and attack type. The text provides charts for various weapons at different ranges (PB, S, Med, L, Ex), indicating damage and hit values.

*   **Attacks:** Weapons have a number of attacks, like "150 rounds 20 times", "30 blasts 33 times", "10 beams 500 times", etc. This suggests a limit or frequency of attacks for each weapon or attack type.

*   **Range Classes:** Weapons have range classes (A, B, C, D), which likely affect their effectiveness at different distances.

*   **Defense:** There is a "Duck and Cover" defensive action, which provides a chance to avoid attacks, indicated as a fraction (e.g., "3 in 10", "4 in 10"). This likely represents a probability or a die roll needed to succeed.

*   **HTH Combat:** Hand-to-hand combat is indicated by the "HTH" range, with attacks like "Thud Stick" and "Bite" having their own damage and hit values.

Other Mechanics:

*   **Stats:** Units have stats like REF (Reflexes), PSY (Psychic), HP (Hit Points), and AR (Armor). These stats likely influence combat effectiveness and survivability.

*   **Speed:** Units have a speed stat (e.g., "5 Km/h"), which likely affects movement and positioning.

*   **Full/1/2/1/4/1/8:** These fractions combined with stats could mean degrees of "damage", "suppression" or "wounds".

- **Attack Resolution:**
    - Weapons have a range class (e.g., C, D) and number of attacks with usage limits.
    - Damage values are specified for different ranges (PB, S, Med, L, Ex)

    - **Salvage Roll:** 1D10 determines the state of vehicles (Functional, Damaged, Immobile).
        - **Functional:** May form a new unit if enough are grouped.
        - **Damaged:** Requires repair (3d10 x 2 manhours), moves at half speed. Rescuing pilots reduces stress.
        - **Immobile:** Requires repair (3d10 x 10 manhours). Rescuing pilots reduces stress.
- **Regeneration:**
    - Some units regenerate HP points per turn.
- **Dice Rolling:**

- **Range Classes:** Weapons have a range class (B, D, E, C).
- **Damage:** Weapons deal different amounts of damage based on range (PB, S, Med, L, Ex). Damage values are listed numerically.
- **Hits:** Indicates the number of hits at different ranges.
- **ECM (Electronic Countermeasures):** Provides a defensive probability (e.g., "Defensive: 4 in 10", "Defensive: 3 in 10", "Defensive: 5 in 10").
- **Evasive Maneuvers:** Requires a minimum speed (e.g., "Must be moving 90 Km/h or more"). Provides a defensive probability (e.g., "Defensive: 6 in 10", "Defensive: 5 in 10").
- **Stats:** REF (Reflexes), PSY (Psychic), HP (Hit Points), AR (Armor Rating), Speed, Shields. Numerical values are associated with each.
- **Speed:** Speed is listed as Full, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8.
- **Reactive Armor:** Some units have reactive armor that adds to their HP against certain damage types.

The skill's value adds to the attribute's Full column.
To attempt a skill, the skill value is added to the attribute's full column, that is the character's chance to be successful.
Some skills require a prerequisite skill. The skill that requires a prerequisite skill cannot have a higher skill value than the prerequisite skill.
Some skills cost more experience to advance. The number in parentheses is the multiplier for the experience cost.

Skills

Skills  are  described  by attribute. The 
attributes  are listed in alphabetical  order and 
the skills under them are listed alphabetically.

Many skills are relatively  easy to  learn 
but  some  require  more  effort  to  gain.  These 
skills  are given a  number  in parentheses like

Example:  A player  wants their  character to 
have  the  Surgery  skill.  They  cannot  perform 
surgery  until  they  have  purchased  the  skill. 
Surgery  has  a  (2)  next  to  the  skill  on  the 
character sheet. Instead of spending one point 
of  XP  to  purchase  the  skill,  they  must  spend 
two.

Skills that require a prerequisite skill cannot be used untrained.

Example:  The  Surgery   skill  requires  the 
prerequisite  skill  Biology.  If  Biology  is a +10 
Surgery cannot be higher than +10.

Focus Skills

A  Focus Skill is  any skill that reaches 
+30 or more. For  every 30 points value a  skill 
has it gets  another Focus, this means  a  skill  at 
+60  has two  focuses  and at  +90  it has three 
focuses.

Having a  Focus on a  skill  gives a +5 to 
the  Half,  Quarter  and  Eighth   fraction 
columns.

Some skills  have  special abilities  that 
a player  can  select when  they  have a focus on 
that  skill.  These  are  effects  that  are  not 
reflected  by  simply   raising  the  skillΓÇÖs   value. 

The  player   records  the  new   ability  for  that 
skill. The character  only  gets one focus ability 
per 30 points of skill value.

Example:  Angie  has  her  HTH  Combat  skill 
raised to  +30. She now  gets a +5 to  her  Half, 
Quarter  and  Eighth  columns when using  this 
skill.  Her  player   also  gets  to  pick  a   focus 
ability  and  they  choose  the  ability  Knockout. 
Angie now has this ability  and cannot choose 
another  until  her  HTH  Combat  skill  gets  to 
+60.

Combat:
*   Damage is dealt to different sizes (S, Med, L, Ex) of targets, and Point Blank (PB) range.

*   Damage values are specified for each weapon against each size category.

*   Blast Range may be a factor.

*   Fire Arcs indicate the angle of attack.

*   Rate of Fire dictates the number of attacks possible in a time period.

*   Some weapons have a Payload statistic, which limits the number of attacks.

*   Recoil: A Projectile Cannon can knock an E-suit down if a piloting roll is not made.

Movement:

*   Mounting certain weapons or armor reduces the E-Suit's top speed.

*   Some weapons prevent flight.

Thrusters:
*   Thrusters may have a 40% chance of critical damage that can lead to a fuel explosion and/or thruster damage that reduces flight speed.

```
If an enemy E-Suit is destroyed, there is a 10% chance of each system being repairable. If the weapon can be repaired, a successful Repair Artillery skill roll will allow it to be added to one of these kits.
All these add ons require a Tech Challenge with 5 CP.

- Adding or removing shields or weaponry requires overcoming a Challenge Point (CP) difficulty. When adding, characters must overcome the listed CP. When removing, the CP is halved for the difficulty, but characters gain improvements equal to the original CP value.
- CP values for adding/removing shields and weaponry are based on the size of the vehicle and the size/power of the shield/weapon.
- Shield sizes are defined by hit points: Light (<200), Medium (<400), Heavy (<600), Super Heavy (>600).
- Weapon sizes are defined by damage at point-blank range: Light (<600), Medium (<1200), Heavy (<10,000), Super Heavy (>10,000). Missile/rocket launcher range also affects weapon size.
- Vehicle Modification Transforms: When a character rolls to make a modification, roll 1d6 on the Successful Transform table if the roll succeeds, or the Failure Transform table if the roll fails.
- Successful Transform table results are:
  1. Decrease fuel capacity or top speed by 2%.
  2. Reduce sensor ECM or ECCM performance by 2%. If the system has an Advantage to use it, reduced it by 2%. If the system has an Impairment to use it, increase it by 2%.
  3. Decrease shield strength or fuel capacity by 2%.
  4. Reduce piloting performance by 2%. If the vehicle has an Advantage to pilot, it is reduced by 2%. If the vehicle has an Impairment to pilot it, increase it by 2%.
  5. Reduce Hit Points or Armor Rating of the vehicle by 2%.
  6. The last modification attempted takes off double CP but The next attempt will require a character to get at least two Fractional Successes to reduce any Challenge Points. Tools may be used to get these two successes.

*   **Failure Transform:** Roll 1d10. Results determine negative effects on a vehicle, such as reduced fuel capacity, sensor performance, damage to systems, injury to characters, or fire. Injury involves a Reflex saving roll to avoid 1d10 damage (or 2d10 to an NPC). Characters gain a 1% Advantage on the Reflex roll per minute the turn took.

*   **Point Blank (PB):** Targets at point blank range get a 20% Advantage to hit.

*   **Extreme Range (Ex):** Targets at extreme range suffer a 90% Impairment to hit.

*   **Long Range (L):** Targets at long range suffer a 40% Impairment to hit.

*   **Medium Range (Med):** Targets at medium range suffer a 20% Impairment to hit.

*   **Short Range (S):** No modifier to hit a target at this range.

*   **Damage:** Weapons inflict damage at point blank, short, medium, long, and extreme ranges.

*   **Stress Effects:** Some stress effects are less than 1 point per hour and are resolved with dice rolls. A "1 in 6 per hour" stress effect requires rolling 1d6; a roll of 1 results in a stress point. A "1 in 10 per hour" stress effect requires rolling 1d10; a roll of 1 results in a stress point.
