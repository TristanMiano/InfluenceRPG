# Rules Directory

This folder contains working rulesets that are actively deployed in the game.
Each ruleset should have its own subdirectory under `rules/`.
Within each ruleset's directory you will find four text files:

- `full_text` - the raw ruleset text
- `summary` - a short summary of the ruleset
- `long_summary` - an expanded summary for reference
- `char_creation` - character creation guidelines specific to the ruleset

These files are loaded into the database to power the game engine.
